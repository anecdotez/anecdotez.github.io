            <p>Thank you for stopping by. I hope to grow this website over time. Topics I intend to discuss include programming, comic-making, writing, textile arts, and cooking. Of course, many other things will likely be discussed when all is said and done. This is meant to be like a little notebook; part journal, part studying space, etc. I do not claim to be an expert on anything, ever. I am simply a little creature trying their best to indulge in the many wonders that the world has to offer. Join me in such an endeavor if you'd like!</p>
