        <p>Not much to report as of late. I haven't gotten started on the other coasters, but I think I'll get that spinning tomorrow. I'm also hoping to learn some more HTML and CSS in the next week or so. Oh yes, and maybe add some art as well. Many little hobbies are simmering... Check back in a few days...</p>
