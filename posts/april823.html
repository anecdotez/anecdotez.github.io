        <p>Today was a good day. Lots of cooking was accomplished, which should help smooth out my upcoming week. Here's a quick recipe for baked drumsticks and rice that serves about three people:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pack of 6-8 chicken drumsticks (preferrably pre-seasoned, like BBQ)</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>Jasmine Rice</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>If the chicken is not already pre-seasoned, season it as you prefer, though lightly.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Position foil so that it covers the top of the chicken as well. When the oven is ready, put the pan in the oven and set a timer for forty minutes.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare a cup of jasmine rice according to the instructions and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Chop up several sprigs of cilantro and set it aside.</li>
            <li>When the forty minute timer is done, move the aluminum foil so that it is no longer covering the top of the drumsticks. Let them continue to cook for ten more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the oven (and turn it off, safety first). In a bowl, prepare a bed of rice using some of what you have set aside. Place the cooked chicken in the rice.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the sesame oil and soy sauce over the chicken and rice to your liking. Sprinkle cilantro over the finished product for a splash of color and flavor!</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Okay, it's not the clearest recipe, but perhaps it can give you some ideas. In other news, I'd like to try and make a placemat tomorrow. I tend to eat at my desk, but it's rather inexpensive and I'm afraid of damaging the surface by trying to clean it. A placemat and coasters would definitely help assuage those worries. I could knit or crochet it. I think I'll try knitting it to get in some practice. We shall see...</p>
